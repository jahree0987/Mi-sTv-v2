Without a strong and benevolent leader, the rest of the nation is left to drown in poverty, strife, and ruin.

Not willing to compete, Kasumi declines Olivia's offer to join the fun, but eventually gets involved anyway and dispenses her own brand of mischief. Soon, a strange friendship blossoms between the peculiar trio, and they decide to form the Pastime Club, where they are free to resume their daily hijinks.",
